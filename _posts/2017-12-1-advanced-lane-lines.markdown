* Developed an advanced lane-finding algorithm using distortion correction, image rectification, color transforms, and gradient thresholding. Identified lane curvature and vehicle displacement.

* Implemented a novel solution comprised of Adaptive Thresholding to overcome environmental challenges such as shadows and pavement changes
