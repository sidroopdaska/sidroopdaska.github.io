The goal of the Behavioural Cloning project was to:

* Develop an end-to-end Deep Learning solution for self-driving cars in a simulated environment.

* The motivation behind this approach is that the system automatically learns internal representations of the processes required to parse an input of the environment in the form of an image from a front facing camera and output a steering angle in response. This approach is inspired from the work done by <a href="http://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf" target="_blank">NVIDIA</a> where there was no explicit decomposition of the problem, such as lane line detection, path planning and control. The end-to-end system optimizes all the processing steps simultaneously.

* Succesfully complete atleast one lap of Track 1

* Evaulate the model performance on Track 2 (alot harder due to varying light conditions and sharp turns)
